                    <article>
                            <h5>This is me</h5>
                            My name is Sara Överström and I am 31 years old. Not long ago I made a decision <br> 
                            to start studying Front End Developer at KYH Stockholm, and it was the best thing 
                            I have ever done.  I just started coding 2 moths ago and I  love it. <br>It’s not easy
                            to find something in life that challenges you and is fun and inspiring at the same
                            time.<br> <br>I love how every day coding challenges both my mind and me as a person. It 
                            lets <br>me explore and find new solutions. It keeps me focused, on my toes and allows<br>
                             me to think out side the box. Every day it leaves me wanting more. <br>

                             I am the class representative to the Management Team of my education. <br>
                             I am always laughing. I am a down to earth, caring person, who loves to hang out <br>
                             with my friends.
                             I also love to dance Square dance and spending time with horses.<br>

                        <h3> &lt; How do I work? &gt;</h3>
                    <article>
                        <h5>Oh that’s a tough one</h5>
                            I am stubborn, determined, and I have a mind of my one.  I like solving problems,<br>
                            meet new people and try new things. During my career I have always worked with people
                            and because of that I ’m very service minded. To help costumers get what they need and 
                            create customer satisfaction is something I care a lot about. <br>
                            <br>I like to work, agileIn, in a team and on my own.  When I work it is important for me to
                            be organised, structured, efficient and flexible.

                        <h3> &lt; What have I done? &gt;</h3>
                    <article>
                        <h5>The short version is</h5>
                            When I was a teenager I worked weekends in a stable as a stable host. My duties were bringing
                            in the horses and helping the riders to get them ready in time for the lesson. This thought me 
                            to be organised, structured and efficient. <br>

                            <br>After finish higschool I bought my own pet shop. It was a great experience and it thought me 
                            to build something out of nothing. It, thought me the value of, customer satisfaction, customer
                            service and the importance of a study costumer base as well as finding new creative ways to find 
                            new ones. <br>It is not easy to be a young businesswoman. You have to have a mind of your own, be driven,
                            focused and organised. You have to be able to handle many things at ones and you can’t be afraid to 
                            meet new people. <br>I had the shop for 5 years and In that time I also became a certified dog trainer 
                            with the SBK. Working as a dog trainer I learned to tackle different types of people, and find ways
                            to get them to work towards a common goal as a team. It also taught me to be direct, consistent and 
                            humble. <br>
                            
                            <br>Before I went back to school and Front End, I worked in the family company Järfälla Låsservice 
                            for 6 years as a locksmith. I was responsible for the work inside the shop. I answered the phone, 
                            booked jobs, took care of costumers.<br> I was responsible for ordering and handling supplies. 
                            I made sure  my coworkers had everything they needed to do a good job. <br>During me time here, 
                            I had to be, service minded, organised, efficient and structured. I had to juggle many things and be
                            able to handle stress. I learned how to be flexible and a team player. I also learned how in a team 
                            if you want to do a good job, every player is important.

                                This was my first assignment. Using a form I had to create a list of
                                all the different educations that my school can offer you. I then had 
                                to make it so you as a visitor could choose the program you wanted. 
                                <br>The form is very simple. You can not yet klick the button to send in your
                                choice , because I have’n learned about backend jet.  When I made this I
                                hade just learned about CSS. You might wonder why there is a guy running
                                on the page. The answer is that I was curious about sprite animations and 
                                I wanted to try it out. <br>

                                <br>At the beginning of the assignment I did not fully understand what to 
                                put in html and what to put in css. I also had to work out how class and id 
                                was connected between the files, and at the end of the assignment it all became clear.

                        <p id="textportfoliopage" >
                            
                                Making the portfolio page my main focus was to make it as personal as possible without 
                                losing the elegant design. <br>

                                <br>I wanted to make the page responsive so that you as a visitor without difficulty 
                                could view it from your phone or iPad. To make this possible I used flex-box. 
                                It took a while to understand it, but once I did, it made my coding much easier. <br>
                                
                                <br>The only JS I used are shown in the circles. I wanted to show my Training ooh focus 
                                levels. <br>
                                
                                <br>The logo in the left corner of the header is an vector picture I made.
